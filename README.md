# hearthlands-optimizer
A Java program to support an Excel spreadsheet meant to optimize gameplay of Hearthlands.

This a personal project meant to entertain and educate me, and this repository exists so I can show my code to my friends and enable them to give me feedback. Forking and doing your own thing is okay, per license specifications. This Java project exists to supplement stuff Excel cannot easily do, such as computing the dependencies graph.

The Excel spreadsheet is unlikely to be released as I fear the inclusion of de-anonymizing metadata.

## Goals
1. List total staff needed to supply a building in function of culture.
2. List number and type of buildings needed to supply a building in function of culture.

### Example
* Question : 
  * Beer brewery?
* Answer :
  * 28 Workers
  * 1 Hops Grower
  * 1 Grain Grower
  * 1 Woodcutter
  * 0.5 Tree Forestry
  * 0.25 Well
  
## Unsollicited Contributions and Pull Requests
### Welcomed contributions
* Remarking offensive wording from a social justice perspective. Ableist slurs like "idiot" are includes. TERFs, SWERFs, ace/aro exclusitionists, and truscums concerns are excluded.
* Remarking that some of my documentation is unclear, unhelpful, or too much. This include commit messages etc.
* Remarking that some of my documentation *might* be too much.
* Identifier names that diverge from the conventional nomenclature.
  * Example : If I were to use "positionInArray", it would be okay to tell me the usual word is "index".
* Telling me I'm trying to reinvent the wheel when I didn't say I wanted to reinvent said wheel.

### Unwelcomed contributions
* Doing the work in my place. I want to learn. Writing some code to explain what you mean doesn't count. For this specific item, and only this specific item, unless otherwise noted, forking doesn't count as a "contribution".

### Welcomed pull requests
* Changes to documentation (comments etc).
* Changes to identifier names.
* Typo corrections.

### Contributions vs Pull requests
Pull requests are a subset of Contributions; *ie*, all pull requests are contributions, but not all contributions are pull requests. The *Welcomed pull requests* section exists to place explicit limitations on the *Unwelcomed contributions* section.

### Contributions not mentionned as welcomed or unwelcomed
*This section intentionally left blank.*

Okay okay lol. I won't leave it blank for real. Anywayz. I don't want to trip myself over the carpet's flowers, so that's why I'm tempted to leave this section blank. My main concern is that autistic people like me would prevent themselves to make contributions I would appreciate by fear of crossing unspoken boundaries. The *Welcomed* sections serve to explicitly mark absences of boundary. Contributions that don't fall in either category of welcomness will be treated with delicateness toward the contributor's feelings.

## Legalese
I do not own the "Hearthlands" trademark. I believe what I am doing counts as fair use or whatever the word. In case of complaints from the trademark holders, I'll just change the name and not give any further care.

Same for the "Excel" trademark, excepted that if Microsoft complains, I will consider fighting them about it with legally acceptable means. (This is mostly code for "throwing a fit on Twitter dot com".)
