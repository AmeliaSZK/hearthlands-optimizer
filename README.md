# hearthlands-optimizer
A Java program to support an Excel spreadsheet meant to optimize my gameplay of Hearthlands.

This a personal project meant to entertain and educate me, and this repository exists so I can show my code to my friends and enable them to give me feedback. Forking and doing your own thing is okay, per license specifications. This Java project exists to supplement stuff Excel cannot easily do, such as computing the dependencies graph.

The Excel spreadsheet is unlikely to be released as I fear the inclusion of de-anonymizing metadata.

## Goals
1. List total staff needed to supply a building in function of culture.
2. List number and type of buildings needed to supply a building in function of culture.

### Example
* Question : 
  * Beer brewery?
* Answer :
  * 28 Workers
  * 1 Hops Grower
  * 1 Grain Grower
  * 1 Woodcutter
  * 0.5 Tree Forestry
  * 0.25 Well

## Legalese
I do not own the "Hearthlands" trademark. I believe what I am doing counts as fair use or whatever the word. In case of complaints from the trademark holders, I'll just change the name and not give any further care.

Same for the "Excel" trademark, excepted that if Microsoft complains, I will consider fighting them about it with legally acceptable means. (This is mostly code for "throwing a fit on Twitter dot com".)
